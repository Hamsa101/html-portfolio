<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Greetings to evey one. This is Hamsa. A student from Banglore, India. Basically I'm taking course in Udemy, Angela Yu's Web Development Course.
  Because of her teachings, I'm able to do this project. I'm really Thankfull for her. And actually her classes are Amazing.</p>

<p>As a student, Everyone will be having doubts like, Is this course beneficial?, Is this course worth the cost of 500Rs?
  What if the classes are not effective and not important at all? For all these Questions, here, I'm the answer. Just join the
  course and you will see the changes.</p>

<p>Being a Computer Science Engineering student, I'm also worried about my studies, placements and about competitive exams too.
  Success in studies isn't about choosing the right path-it's about exploring every possibilities inbetween. So I'm trying my best
  in all the fields. Then i'll find my interest and Master in one.
